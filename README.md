<h1> <b> Subjective Answer Evaluation </b></h1>

This project presents a novel solution for the assessment of student answers
automatically through the combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and 
Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system employs XLNet, a pre-trained
transformer model, to analyze the similarity of student responses and reference
responses. In order to expand the use of the model, EasyOCR, a fast OCR library, is
added to scan text from images of student answers and reference material so that 
handwritten and printed text can be processed smoothly.
